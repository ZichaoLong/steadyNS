\subsection{Data Structure}
Simplex grid partition for the computation domain $\Omega$ is adopted, 
and without damage to the functional setting of Eq.\eqref{eq:Navier-Stokes}, 
we will use periodic boundary conditions at some boundary surfaces of $\Omega$.
The data structure reads as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Coordinate of $N$ nodes: $\{A_i\in\mr^d:i=0,\cdots,N-1\}$.
  \item Periodic source node index: $\{P_i\in\{-1,0,1,\cdots,N-1\}\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$. 
    This indices list is induced by periodic boundary conditions.
    If there exists a source node $A_j$ of $A_i$, then $P_i=j$ is the index of this node, otherwise we set $P_i=-1$. 
    For convenience of programming, 
    A source node may be source of many nodes but never have its own source, 
    i.e. if $j\in\{P_i\}$ then $P_j=-1$.
  \item $M$ elements: $\{e_k:k=0,\cdots,M-1\}\subset\{0,1,\cdots,N-1\}^{d+1}$. 
    Each simplex element $e_k$, e.g. triangle or tetrahedron, has $d+1$ nodes $\{e_k^j\}_{j=0}^{d}$. 
    In the following report, indices of nodes of an element will be supercripts.
  \item Node tag: $\{B_i:i=0,\cdots,N-1\}$, which defines the physical information of $i$-th node
    \begin{description}
      \item[0] interior node
      \item[1] inlet, where $u=(1,0,0)^\top$
      \item[2] outlet, where $u=(1,0,0)^\top$
      \item[3] noslip wall, where $u=(0,0,0)^\top$. 
        Velocity value $u$ on the surface of cylinders/spheres can be changed 
        if angular velocity $\omega\neq0$. Here we only consider flow past still cylinders/spheres.
      \item[4] periodic node
      \item[5] periodic source node
    \end{description}
    Only those nodes with tag $B_i=0$ or $B_i=5$ have degrees of freedom.
\end{itemize}
In the following report, we use $i\in e_k$ and $i\sim j$ to represent the 
relation of containing and neighbouring respectively, i.e.
the $i\in\{e_k^j:j=0,\cdots,d\}$ and 
we say $i\sim j$ if and only if there exists an element $e_k$ $\st i,j\in e_k$.
